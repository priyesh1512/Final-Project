# Web App Development - IT341

**Teacher**: Mr. Rindra Razafinjatovo  
**Office**: IT114

## Project Overview

This project is developed as part of the **Web App Development (IT341)** course and was assigned by **Mr. Rindra Razafinjatovo** as a case study project.

### Case Study: Managing Daily Operations for Rindra Delivery Service

Rindra Delivery Service requires a web application to manage daily operations, including tracking delivery orders, assigning drivers, and allowing clients to view their order status. The application will be developed using **PHP**, **MySQL**, and **Bootstrap**, focusing on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

### Project Requirements

Students need to achieve the following tasks:

1. **Object-Oriented Design**:  
   Develop appropriate classes for core entities such as `Order`, `Admin`, `User`, `Driver`, and `Client`. Implement OOP best practices, ensuring the code is modular and easy to maintain.

2. **Order Management**:  
   Allow admins to create and manage delivery orders, update statuses, and assign orders to drivers. Ensure that the system validates inputs properly.

3. **Delivery Tracking**:  
   Implement real-time tracking, where drivers update statuses, and admins view delivery progress.

4. **Client Portal**:  
   Create a portal for clients to log in and check the status of their orders. They should also be able to view their order history.

5. **Frontend Design**:  
   Design a responsive, user-friendly interface using **Bootstrap** for all users, including admins, drivers, and clients.

6. **Secure Authentication**:  
   Implement secure user authentication, with encrypted passwords and role-based access controls for admins, drivers, and clients.

7. **Database Interaction**:  
   Use **PDO** for secure database queries and ensure data validation and error handling across the application.

8. **Final Submission**:  
   Ensure the project is fully functional with thorough testing, and all features meet the specified requirements.

### Milestones and Timeline

- **Week 1**:  
  Focus on designing the class structure, setting up the database, and implementing basic order management functionality.
  
- **Week 2**:  
  Complete the remaining features, including delivery tracking, client portal, and secure authentication. Finalize UI and test the app thoroughly before submission.
